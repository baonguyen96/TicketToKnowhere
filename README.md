Problem: With the Guardians of the Galaxy making Knowhere their base of operations, that sector of space has become rather popular. This popularity brings with it extra traffic and is putting a strain on the intergalactic docking station. Ships are now required to pay for time at the docking station. Those ships that stay longer than their time allotment will receive an automated ticket. You have been hired to write a program that will help generate tickets for parking violations at Knowhere.
Functionality: This program will utilize a linked list as a queue. The ships will dock at the station if there is room and if not the ships will form a queue. Before docking, the ship will pay for time at the docking station. When the ship undocks, the time will be checked to see if the ship stayed longer than the time purchased. If so, a ticket will be generated. When a ship undocks, if there are ships in the queue, the first ship in the queue will dock at the docking station.
